      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>(Eric Mueller TF) and we were stuck in programming class learning this scary topic of GITHUB.
          Figured I would add something to this file until Maggie is able to join the dialogue.
          Woe, I just heard a creaking door...
      </p>
      <p> (Debjani) remember I will be at the mentor center from Thursday...
           I do not have her github ID to add her as a collaborator..
      </p>
      <p>(EM TF) Ok, wish you the best in that class.  I may be moved there in the future so may 
	cross paths again.
	Cant say we did not try to combine Maggie.
	FYI I just added a second branch named 'darker01' if u wanna practice MERGING. I will
	send a pull request.
	The creaking door was from the winds picking up from Hurricane Irma, reminding me again that I knew 
	it was a bad idea to move to Key West FL for this developer job.
	 The weather man on TV just said it increased to a class4 and
	that it gained speed towards... just then the power goes out.
